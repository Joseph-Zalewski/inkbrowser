This is a specification of the JavaScript object format used for messages passed between Views.
Any of these fields may fail to be defined, and the behavior of processNotify(object) is determined by the subclass of View implementing it; however, this document should be taken as providing the normative guidelines for what a subclass should use these fields for.

text - any text information

query - must be a valid SPARQL query, and must remain valid when a LIMIT clause is appended to it

limit - a number, giving a desired number of query results

endpoint - an address of a SPARQL endpoint; should be an endpoint which can answer the query stored in <<<query>>>.

gatekeeper - a function which will be called by (most) views upon receiving the message; if it returns false, the rest of the message will not be processed.
