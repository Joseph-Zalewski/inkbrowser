Most of the files in this repo can be safely ignored!
The only ones that matter as far as code goes are:
sdbrowser/__init__.py
sdbrowser/templates/client.html

In addition, sdbrowser/templates/schema1.json is a readable example of the internal schema format (only need to know if you are creating schema diagrams.)

In __init__.py:
Only the client() and query() functions matter now. The rest is left over from testing and I will eventually delete it. __init__.py is effectively finished.

In client.html:
This file is in more of a state of flux. Not everything is exactly as depicted in the architecture diagram (yet).

Things that can be expected to remain static:
The View class. The GraphView subclass illustrates the conventional boilerplate for (old-style) Javascript subclass creation.

Implementing a new View subclass:
The constructor must take "collection" as its first argument. Then it can have additional arguments (e.g. DOMNode). If it is supposed to respond to messages from other 
views, this must be done by implementing the processNotify() function (this should have a single parameter expecting a Javascript Object, but it doesn't yet); to
pass information *to* the other views, you do something like (...create message object M...); for(var v of collection){v.processNotify(M)};
